  When asked about what I do for work I proudly say I have been a Technical
  Writer for over 20 years. I have worked for many IT companies in many
  capacities and finally found that documenting different organization's
  hardware and software needs are rewarding. However, requiring additional
  stimulation and outlets for creativity I have used my Radio and TV production
  degree as radio talk show host on terrestrial and internet radio. I have been
  an actor, stand-up comedian, and hosted a short-lived game show. I also have a
  couple of published short story novels out in the verse as well. More recently
  (for five years ending in 2015), I produced a steampunk magazine
  (www.ladiesofsteampunk.com). Editor in Chief duties aside it was pretty much a
  one-person production taking care of interviews, articles, sales, advertising,
  marketing, and design. I have handed over the project of publication to one of
  my close friends and as such am taking the time to relax from the grueling
  additional 40+ hours a week it took to make it work. I am a geek... science,
  technology, comedy, politics, movies and media, medical advancements, and
  gaming. We all geek out about something, buuuuut I might be pushing my
  interests to collect knowledge a bit far.
