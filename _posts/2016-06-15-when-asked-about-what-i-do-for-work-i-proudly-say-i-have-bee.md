When asked about what I do for work I proudly say I have been a Technical Writer for over 20 years. I have worked for many IT companies in many capacities and finally found that documenting different organization's hardware and software needs are rewarding.

However, requiring additional creative outlets I have used my Radio and TV production degree as radio talk show host on terrestrial and internet radio. I have been an actor, stand-up comedian, and hosted a short-lived game show. I also have a couple of published short story novels out in the verse as well. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0f321892-890d-4dba-93a0-06bd010d3549.jpg)

For five years, ending in 2015, I produced a steampunk magazine (www.ladiesofsteampunk.com). Editor in Chief duties aside it was pretty much a one-person production taking care of interviews, articles, sales, advertising, marketing, and design. I have handed over the project of publication to one of my close friends and as such am taking the time to relax from the grueling additional 40+ hours a week it took to make it work. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a435548-8f53-47e7-ac9e-021ab8599aa4.jpg)

I am a geek... science, technology, comedy, politics, movies and media, medical advancements, and gaming. We all geek out about something, buuuuut I might be pushing my interests to collect knowledge a bit far.
