Ladies of Steampunk

The Ladies of Steampunk Magazine was a passion project that I put almost all of my freetime into. I loved the community, writing, and exploring the Steampunk world. I wrote about makers, builders, tinkerers, movies, games, and music... a lot of musicians jumped on the genre.

Ladies of Steampunk was originally a calendar project that started back in 2009\. Beautiful Steampunk'd models and themes. The project quickly grew into a full bi-monthly magazine and the time and effort required ramped up with it.

I created the magazine for three years and let it go to another producer after changing it's name to The Hourglass in 2015\.

I love looking over my issues and I hope you will get an idea of the work and dedication required to make this fantastic publication. Here are a few links to the [Ladies of Steampunk][0] website:
