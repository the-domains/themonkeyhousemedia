I worked with a California Highway Patrol (CHP) system update team to development the hardware installation and upgrade processes for CHP computers, communication resources, and 911 dispatch centers.

I worked in a disaster recovery development team to build an emergency recovery process for their new disaster recovery data center. I developed implementation and operational documentation for the data centers network with detailed topologies, software applications, hardware installation plans, and infrastructure (security, power, and cabling processes). I worked closely with the testing team to develop system test documentation that closely represented disaster scenarios. I created emergency disaster recovery procedures for IT support, nurses, and administrative staff. I also created standards for employees who were required to adhere to HIPAA requirements during emergencies.

This process required adherence to HIPAA compliant (patient privacy rights) documentation standards. I then presented the documentation to the State of California Department of Health Services approval board.
