            <description><![CDATA[<p>When asked about what I do for work I proudly say I have been a Technical Writer for over 20 years. I have worked for many IT companies in many capacities and finally found that documenting different organization's hardware and software needs are rewarding. However, requiring additional stimulation and outlets for creativity I have used my Radio and TV production degree as radio talk show host on terrestrial and internet radio. I have been an actor, stand-up comedian, and hosted a short-lived game show. I also have a couple of published short story novels out in the verse as well. More recently (for five years ending in 2015), I produced a steampunk magazine (www.ladiesofsteampunk.com). Editor in Chief duties aside it was pretty much a one-person production taking care of interviews, articles, sales, advertising, marketing, and design. I have handed over the project of publication to one of my close friends and as such am taking the time to relax from the grueling additional 40+ hours a week it took to make it work. I am a geek... science, technology, comedy, politics, movies and media, medical advancements, and gaming. We all geek out about something, buuuuut I might be pushing my interests to collect knowledge a bit far.</p>]]></description>
